## planning

- Install Vitest for unit testing.
- Set up a testing script.
- Define the challenge.
- Provide a README file with appropriate documentation.
- Write the unit test to validate the following output.
  ```
    #
   ###
  #####
  ```
  - crete a loop to count how many odd number are in the rowsNumber.
  - calculate how many empty string are required
  - calculate how many hash character ar required
  - concatenate in a string the half/value of the empty string required, the pyramid caracter and the remaining half of the half/value of the empty string remained
  - add a new line input at the end of the string.
  - return the function
  - create a boundary testing to consider possible scenarios
- Write the function to generate the test output.
- implement tests for different scenarios.
- Submit the solution to Codewars.
